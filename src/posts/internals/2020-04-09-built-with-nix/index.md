# Building a reproducible blog with Nix

This blog is hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). As Github Pages aside static HTML content do only support building **Je**kyll pages natively at some point a website like this has to be **generated**, i.e. turned into static HTML content. This means Markdown has to be converted to HTML static pages like the [homepage](/) and [archive](/archive.html) have to be created, as are [RSS](/rss.xml) and [ATOM](/atom.xml) feeds. In this blog's case this is done by a haskell DSL [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/). More details about that can be found in [prior articles](2019-12-31-built-with-hakyll-part-1.html).

In order to keep everything in the same place I use [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) as means to automatically build and publish this blog as I push updates or merge pull requests.

**Was this not an article about Nix?**

Yes indeed it is. In order to create reproducible builds of this blog I employ the [Nix](https://nixos.org/nix) package manager. But in order...

## What is Nix?

Nix is sort of a hybrid between a package manager and a build system. The Nix homepage states:

> Nix is a powerful package manager for Linux and other Unix systems that makes package management reliable and reproducible. It provides atomic upgrades and rollbacks, side-by-side installation of multiple versions of a package, multi-user package management and easy setup of build environments.

Sounds... good? What does all of that mean though?

Nix (the package manager) is build around the functional programming language `nix` (what a coincidence, ha?). A program, library, etc. is build by Nix as the output of a pure function. Runtime/Buildtime dependencies go in mix with the sources of the package are build in an isolated space and output an executable, or whatnot you want to have build. Such a function is called a **Derivation**.

Everything that should be built with Nix has to be described as such a function. In fact the whole set of packages that is there is just [a giant collection](https://github.com/nixos/nixpkgs) of functions each defined in their own files.

The isolated manner in which the packages are built also shows in the way they are managed. All packages are installed as such

```
/nix/store/6fgjp1wsv1w44f890f6kvwywjnc32svr-zoxide-0.2.1/bin/zoxide
```

Lets take this apart


`/nix/store/`
:   This is the nix store all packages are contained in this folder

`6fgjp1wsv1w44f890f6kvwywjnc32svr`
:   This is a hash of the producing function, it takes into account the function itself, and its inputs
:   It also easens binary caching.

`zoxide`
:   the package's name

`0.2.1`
:   the packaged version

`/bin/zoxide`
:   the actual executable
:   actually the file structure of packages is similar to what you would normally find in places like `/usr` or `~/.local/`


Yet, while that package might exists in the store, this does not mean it is *installed* or usable. --- Huh?

You see, the hash we have seen right now is there for a reason. It allows to have multiple versions of one and the same program at the same time, even with the same version. Normally all packages are build according to one specific state of the `nixpkgs` repo. `.nix` files get evaluated by writing a build instruction file (`.drv`). This resolves all dependencies (building them if they do not exist yet), prepares the package's source and combines those into a hash. If one instead builds it with a newer version where some dependency was updated or changed, not only this derivations hash changes it also happens to change the target derivation's hash forcing it to rebuild using the new dependency. The same happens if sources change. As a result many different versions of a package can coexist in the store.

:::{.note}
### Notice

As nix functions are pure, **wherever** one uses the same `nixpkgs` instance the exact same inputs are used to create the exact same output. Also, it makes little to no difference on which machine the package is built. The binary will be the same(ish).

Actually, there is a [project](https://r13y.com/) tracking how many build (of a vital subset of nix) are reproducible on two different machines.
:::

### How to install/use packages?

#### Global installation

There are different ways to achive this. Using nix locally the easiest but least idiomatic would be

```sh
$ nix-env -iA zoxide
```

this installs `zoxide`^[[`zoxide`](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide) a great (fast) replacement for `z`] globally for the current user, by linking all of zoxides contents to a special directory (`~/.nix-profile/`). The `bin` contents of this directory are on the `$PATH` making the package's binary available to the user.

As mentioned this is not idiomatic Nix which focuses on declerativity. If you want something installed consider using [`home-manager`](https://github.com/rycee/home-manager) or add packages to your `configuration.nix` if you are on [NixOS](https://nixos.org/nixos)

#### Local usage

If you need a program but do not want to install it because you dont need it often and you don't want to cliutter your `$PATH` or it's a project specific tool you can make use of either `nix run` or `nix-shell`.

```sh
$ nix run nixpkgs.git
```

This will drop you into a bash shell with git available.

```sh
$ nix-shell -p git
```

will essentially do the same but can do much more.

- `nix-shell` accepts multiple packages

- can be used as a shebang ([see](https://gist.github.com/travisbhartwell/f972aab227306edfcfea))

- can drop you into development environments of a specific derivation ([see](https://nixos.org/nixos/nix-pills/developing-with-nix-shell.html))

- can be used to make development environments for a project.

Let's focus on the last point for this article.


## Nix on this blog

This blog uses a shell environment in which I have all the tools I need at hand. Let's look at the structure file by file

### `default.nix`

[`default.nix`](https://github.com/ysndr/blog/default.nix) files are read by nix if no other file is given to the command it contains most of what I could want.

Generally my `default.nix` look like this:

```nix
{pkgs ? import (if pin == false then <nixpkgs> else pin) {},

 pin ? ./nixpkgs.nix, ... }:

with pkgs;

let

<some packages and configuration>

shell = mkShell {

​    name = "<name>";

​    buildInputs = [ <packages I want in my shell> ];

​    shellHook = '' # shell command to be executed  when I enter the shell

​    '';

}

in

{

​    inherit shell;

​    inherit packageA, packageB, ...;

}
```

This exposes a shell environment for `nix-shell` and programs to be executed directy using `nix-build`.

so what about this blog `default.nix`?

```nix
let

  all-hies = import (builtins.fetchTarball "https://github.com/infinisil/all-hies/tarball/master") {};

in

{pkgs ? import (if pin == false then <nixpkgs> else pin) {},

 pin ? ./nixpkgs.nix, ... }:

with pkgs;

let
```

Aside from the default I only priorly import what is `all-hies` which is a  project that maintains the [Haskell Ide Engine](https://github.com/infinisil/all-hies) on Nix.



```nix
# -------------- Utils -------------

nur = import (builtins.fetchTarball "https://github.com/nix-community/NUR/archive/master.tar.gz") {

​    pkgs=pkgs;

};

script = {...} @ args: nur.repos.ysndr.lib.wrap ({

  shell = true;

} // args);
```

This are utilities I might use. [NUR](https://github.com/nix-community/NUR) is the nix version of arch AUR albeit not nearly as active sadly. from My own collection I use the `shell` script which helps me putting together runnable scripts.

```nix
# ------------- Haskell ------------

hie = all-hies.selection { selector = p: { inherit (p) ghc865; }; };

myHaskellPackages = haskell.packages.ghc865.extend( self: super: { });
```

These lines prepare the Haskell environment I use here. I do not override anything from ghc so this is a bit superflous.

```nix
# ------------ dist ---------------

thirdparty = linkFarm "thirdparty" [

  {

​    name = "uikit";

​    path = (fetchTarball "https://github.com/uikit/uikit/archive/v3.2.4.tar.gz") + "/src";

  }

];
```

I import all third party tools (only uikit currently) into the nix store.

```nix
# ------------- generator -----------

generator = myHaskellPackages.callCabal2nix "Site" ./generator {};

generator-with-thirdparty = generator.overrideAttrs(old: {

  nativeBuildInputs = old.nativeBuildInputs or [] ++ [makeWrapper];

  installPhase = old.installPhase + "\n" + ''

​    wrapProgram $out/bin/generator --set THIRDPARTY ${thirdparty}

  '';

});
```

Then, I define the `generator` as a derivation from its Cabal file and the corresponding "Site" executable key defined in `./generator/`. `generator-with-thirdparty` makes what I imported as thirdparty content available under the `$THIRDPARTY` environment variable.

:::{.note}

**Notice:** `myHaskellPackages.callCabal2nix "Site" ./generator {};` is a great tool to quickly make haskell programms available through Nix.

Similar helpers also exist for Stack.

:::



```nix
# --------------- Commands ----------------

generate-website = script {

  name = "generate-website";

  paths = [generator-with-thirdparty git];

  script = ''

​    generator rebuild

  '';

};
```

`generate-website` is supposed to be a build command which, at this state, only runs `generator rebuild`.

```Nix
# ---------------- Shell ------------------

haskell-env = myHaskellPackages.ghcWithHoogle (

  hp: with hp; [ cabal-install ]

  ++ generator.buildInputs );

shell = { enable-hie ? false }: mkShell {

  name = "blog-env";

  buildInputs = [

​    # put packages here.

​    # generator

​    haskell-env

​    (lib.optional (enable-hie) hie)

  ];

  shellHook = ''

​    export THIRDPARTY="${thirdparty}"

​    export HIE_HOOGLE_DATABASE="${haskell-env}/share/doc/hoogle/default.hoo"

​    export NIX_GHC="${haskell-env}/bin/ghc"

​    export NIX_GHCPKG="${haskell-env}/bin/ghc-pkg"

​    export NIX_GHC_DOCDIR="${haskell-env}/share/doc/ghc/html"

​    export NIX_GHC_LIBDIR=$( $NIX_GHC --print-libdir )

  '';

};
```

Finally, I bundle all together to build an environment with `ghc` and a Hoogle index containing the generators dependencies as well as `cabal-install` **for reasons**.

The shell has this haskell environment and optionally the `hie` executable exposed. It also sets some exports that hie needs to properly function as well as the `$THIRDPARTY` variable to build the blog

```nix
in {

  inherit shell generator generate-website ;

  ci = {

​    compile = generate-website;

  };

}
```
All important parts are exported.

### `shell.nix` and `nixpkgs.nix`

The first file is used by nix-shell by default. All it does is calling the shell attribute of the `default.nix` and controlling if hie is added making use of the lazy nature of nix which means hie will not get evaluated unless enabled.

```nix
{ pin ? null, enable-hie ? false } @ args:

(import ./default.nix args).shell { inherit enable-hie; }
```

The `nixpkgs.nix` file defines a common snapshot of the nixpkgs repo, and is therefore important to ensure everything works on other machines.

```nix
{}: import (builtins.fetchTarball {

  url = "https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/archive/88d9f776091.tar.gz";

  sha256 = "sha256:0z8a0g69fmbbzi77jhvhwafv73dn5fg3gsr0q828lss6j5qpx995";

}) {}
```

:::{.note}

**Notice:** snapshots like these also allow rollbacks as they define which versions of dependencies get passed on.

## Nix and Github Actions

Nix has some integration with github actions through [install-nix](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/install-nix) an action that **installs nix** •_•

With nix installed I run `$(nix-build -A ci.compile --no-out-link)` to make Nix build the blog generator and rebuild the blogs content into `build/site`. This works because `nix-build --no-out-link` will just print the path of the resulting package to `stdout` which in this case is only an executable script produced by the `script` function above. The next step is to take that content and push it to the deployment branch.

[See more...](https://github.com/ysndr/blog/blob/release/.github/workflows/main.yml)

:::{.note}

I previously did even more with nix but specific GitHub actions tend to do the job well enough.

## Epilog

I see this has become more of a roundup about Nix. Nix is **huge** though.. and this article does not try to capture everything (obviously). I hope from reading this, you have a rough idea of what nix does and how it was applied here. If you knew Nix already, maybe you found something new or interesting among this pile of words and snippets. If you did not know Nix before, I hope this article was still interesting to you.

:::{.info}

If you are hooked on the Idea now, further fine grained introduction and resources are:

- The [Nix-Pills](https://nixos.org/nixos/nix-pills/)
- The **unofficial** [wiki](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Nix)
- The nixpkgs [repo](https://github.com/nixos/nixpkgs). Trust me, if you plan to try out nix, bookmark this project and use the issue search.
