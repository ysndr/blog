Ambient intelligence (AmI) research builds upon advances in sensors and sensor networks, pervasive computing, and artificial intelligence. Because these contributing fields have experienced tremendous growth in the last few years, AmI research has strengthened and expanded. Because AmI research is maturing, the resulting technologies promise to revolutionarize daily human life by making people’s surroundings flexible and adaptive. In this paper, we provide a survey of the technologies that comprise ambient intelligence and of the applications that are dramatically affected by it. In particular, we specifically focus on the research that makes AmI technologies “intelligent”. We also highlight challenges and opportunities that AmI researchers will face in the coming years.},

A challenge facing the development of realistic and deployable context-aware services, therefore, is the ability to handle ambiguous context. In this paper, we describe an architecture that supports the building of context-aware services that assume context is ambiguous and allows for mediation of ambiguity by mobile users in aware environments. We illustrate the use of our architecture and evaluate it through three example context-aware services, a word predictor system, an In/Out Board, and a reminder tool.},

  abstract = {Internet of thing, or Connected Objects (IOT) is considering a modern concept. A few years ago, the IoT has invaded our professional and personal life revolutionizing the near future. Indeed, the goal is to create an environment composed of intelligent devices and systems which can communicate with each other through computer networks. These data exchanges allow better decision-making in an increasingly complex context. The success of the Internet depends on the widespread adoption of clearly defined protocols. It represents a common language to all connected systems, regardless of brand, operating system or software tools used. In the absence of such a common language, the Internet would be reduced to a patchwork of proprietary and incompatible networks. This research analyses some of the major evolving and enabling protocols in the IoT. Particularly, it focuses on Layer Network and applications Protocols. Our study evaluates their capabilities and compares their main characteristics and behaviors in terms of various criteria of these protocols. The comparison presented in this paper would benefit researchers and developers in selecting an appropriate protocol for the IoT applications. In This paper we aim to provide first a complete overview of the IoT architecture, then the different protocols. In addition, we present a comparative of application and network layer protocols.},

Many VoIP applications ignore the security problems, and are vulnerable for a large number of attacks. Audio streams and signalling information (such information about as who you are calling) are sent without using any encryption. On public hotspots it is often trivial to listen in on calls. When the systems are widely deployed we can expect problems with eavesdropping, unwanted calls (SPAM/SPIT, for example viruses making phones ring) etc. Since the user of the Internet phone is often alerted at each incoming call attempt the problem is likely to be bigger than it is for electronic mail.},

However, the self-adaptive behaviour lacks of success if it does not correspond to the user’s personal interaction habits and intentions, particularly for complex scenarios with a high degree of user interaction. Concerning the interaction design, such adaptations can be irritating and distracting for the user if they do not match the current situation. In this article we provide a solution how to integrate the user in the self-adaptation feedback loop. The user will be able to influence the adaptation behaviour at run-time and in the long term by setting individual preferences. Consequently, we achieve a harmonisation between full application autonomy and user control. We implemented our generic concepts by extending an existing self-adaptation middleware with capabilities to respect the user’s application focus and interaction behaviour. A notification-based solution for user participation has been evaluated in a substantial user study with 62 participants. Although participants perceived much better control with our solution, the study made clear that notification design is specific for each adaptation type.},

The Internet of Things (IoT) devices are typically connected over a wireless medium, given the large geographical distribution area and the increasing demand for flexible installations. In some cases, a combination of wired and wireless connectivity can be assumed as common practice. In both scenarios, wireless communications for IIoT networks is a fundamental component of the system architecture that needs to satisfy stringent requirements such as reliable connectivity and minimal delays. Therefore, the dependability of wireless communications for IIoT networks should be carefully studied to provide new solutions, which can guarantee that applications can meet their real-time and reliability requirements while optimizing the control capability of the overall network. This paper focuses on the dependable wireless communications in the IIoT networks, where wireless control and monitoring tasks need to meet stringent real-time and reliability constraints. After reviewing recent solutions and discussing their suitability for IIoT networks, we highlight the yet open challenges that needs to be tackled by both academia and industry.},

  abstract = {Ubiquitous sensing enabled by Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies cuts across many areas of modern day living. This offers the ability to measure, infer and understand environmental indicators, from delicate ecologies and natural resources to urban environments. The proliferation of these devices in a communicating–actuating network creates the Internet of Things (IoT), wherein sensors and actuators blend seamlessly with the environment around us, and the information is shared across platforms in order to develop a common operating picture (COP). Fueled by the recent adaptation of a variety of enabling wireless technologies such as RFID tags and embedded sensor and actuator nodes, the IoT has stepped out of its infancy and is the next revolutionary technology in transforming the Internet into a fully integrated Future Internet. As we move from www (static pages web) to web2 (social networking web) to web3 (ubiquitous computing web), the need for data-on-demand using sophisticated intuitive queries increases significantly. This paper presents a Cloud centric vision for worldwide implementation of Internet of Things. The key enabling technologies and application domains that are likely to drive IoT research in the near future are discussed. A Cloud implementation using Aneka, which is based on interaction of private and public Clouds is presented. We conclude our IoT vision by expanding on the need for convergence of WSN, the Internet and distributed computing directed at technological research community.},

  abstract = {The Hayes command set (also known as the AT command set) is a specific command language originally developed by Dennis Hayes for the Hayes Smartmodem 300 baud modem in 1981. The command set consists of a series of short text strings which can be combined to produce commands for operations such as dialing, hanging up, and changing the parameters of the connection. The vast majority of dial-up modems use the Hayes command set in numerous variations. The command set covered only those operations supported by the earliest 300 bit/s modems. When new commands were required to control additional functionality in higher speed modems, a variety of one-off standards emerged from each of the major vendors. These continued to share the basic command structure and syntax, but added any number of new commands using some sort of prefix character – \& for Hayes and USR, and \textbackslash{} for Microcom, for instance. Many of these were re-standardized on the Hayes extensions after the introduction of the SupraFAXModem 14400 and the market consolidation that followed. The term "Hayes compatible" was and as of 2018 still is important within the industry.},

The DSP considered in this paper is the Texas Instruments (TI) TMS320C28x DSP (C28x). At the edge of the network, the C28x is programmed using low-level Embedded C programming language to construct the Morlet wavelet. Our implementation at this layer is the first known construction of the Morlet wavelet for C28x DSP using Embedded C. At the fog layer, near the edge of the IoT network, where more computing resources exist, the wavelet is then convolved with healthcare (electrocardiogram) and electrical network signals, using Matlab to reduce signal noise, and to identify important parts of examined signals. Convolution results indicates that the distributed computing approach for low-cost generic devices considered in this paper is suitable for use in large IIoT networks.},
